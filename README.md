# 🎮 Vibe Coding Boss RPG

I’m experimenting with building an RPG game using **vibe coding**.  
Rather than aiming for perfection, this project focuses on **rapid iteration, intuition, and fun**.

---

## ✨ About the Project

This project started with a few simple questions:

- How far can I go by building a game with vibe coding?
- Can I make something fun without over-designing everything upfront?

The result is a **boss-focused RPG project**, built step by step through experimentation.

- Less emphasis on heavy story
- More focus on combat and boss mechanics
- Fast iteration over rigid planning

## 🕹️ Game Concept

- **Genre**: RPG / Boss Battle
- **Core Features**
  - Boss-centered combat
  - Simple but satisfying skill mechanics
  - Gradually increasing difficulty
- **Graphics**: Pixel art (planned)
- **Mode**: Single-player

## 🛠️ Development Approach

- **Vibe Coding**
  - Build first, refine later
  - Intuition over perfect architecture
- Features are added incrementally
- Anything that isn’t fun gets removed without hesitation
